## Course Description
Modern technology has led to the generation of unprecedented amounts of data, prompting the need to train researchers to leverage data for decision-making in public health and medicine. This course assumes no prior knowledge and serves as a gentle, practical introduction to data wrangling, visualizing, and modeling data using the R statistical programming language. We also emphasize the importance of reproducible research and effective data science communication.


## Learning Objectives
Upon successful completion of this course, you should be able to:
* Write reproducible code using the statistical programming language R 
* Clean and wrangle data for downstream analysis
* Perform exploratory data analysis, including visualizations
* Apply machine learning models for regression and classification



## What is the structure of this course?
This course will be held synchronously and in-person. We encourage students to attend class
and participate, but it is not required, and all lectures and lab sessions will be recorded and
available on the course Canvas site.

We will learn these concepts through six data analysis projects. Grades will be based on:

* 4 homeworks (40%)
* 1 take-home midterm (25%)
* 1 final project (35%)


## [Homeworks](/homework/)
All [homeworks](/homework/) will involve writing code and communicating results. **Students must submit the RMarkdown file <ins>AND</ins> knitted html file associated with each assignment in their individual repository**. A private repository for each assignment will be created for each student and will only be visible to the student and course teaching staff. 

Each student is given two late days per homework assignment. A late day extends the individual homework deadline by 24 hours without penalty. No more than two late days may be used on any one assignment. Late days are intended to give students flexibility: students can use them for any reason, no questions asked. Student don’t get any bonus points for not using late days. Also, students can only use late days for the individual homework deadlines - all other deadlines (e.g., project milestones, midterm exam) are hard.

Although each student is given late days, we will be accepting homework from students that pass this limit. However, we will be deducting 10% (10 points) for each extra late day.

**Due to the unpredictable nature of COVID-19 students in need of extra time to complete assignments should reach out to Student Affairs at StudentAffairs[at]hsph.harvard.edu. A staff member will work with you and Dr. Li to accommodate you. You can also contact Student Affairs if you have a learning disability that requires accommodations. We will ensure you are accommodated as needed.**

The TFs must be able to knit submitted RMarkdown files. The penalty for not being able to knit a file while grading increases for each subsequent homework – see breakdown below. To avoid this, students should be sure to include relative paths to files, data, images, etc. rather than absolute paths. Examples of how to include paths will be given in lecture and lab sessions. Students may also double check with the teaching staff before submitting assignments. 

* 0 points for HW1
* 5 points for HW2
* 10 points for HW3
* 15 points for HW4

**Students may ask questions about the assignments during lecture, but we ask that any questions about grading be directed to the TFs or Dr. Li outside of lecture and lab sessions via email.**

## [Take-home Midterm](/midterm)
A take-home [midterm](/midterm) will be distributed in the form of an RMarkdown file in October (date TBD) to test comprehension of course material. The exam will consist of multiple-choice questions that may or may not require writing code, coding questions and short answer questions. All code used and text answers must be submitted using the RMarkdown file. Students will have 1 week to work on the exam and must submit the exam via Canvas by 11:59pm on the deadline (TBD). **Students are encouraged to use lecture slides and code, lab material, homework assignments and the Internet to work on the exam, but may not work or consult with other students. The teaching staff will be available to answer any questions concerning the exam.**

## [Final Project](/project) 
Students will work in small groups on a month-long data science [project](/project) . The goal of the project is to go through the complete data science process to answer an assigned prompt. You will be given a dataset and series of questions to answer. You will design your visualizations, run statistical analyses, and communicate results. A full description is available on the course website.

## Course Readings
None. Instead, students are encouraged to read the [lecture documents](/lectures) and other [resources](/resources) available on the course Canvas site and the course GitHub repository.
